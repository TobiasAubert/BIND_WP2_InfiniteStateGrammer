    Generate chord states from two pitch dictionaries. A seed is manditory to replicate states if needed.
    It generets chords left-left, right-right, left-right
    The order of the chords will be shuffeld before returned

    Args:
        pitches_left (dict[str, int]): Mapping note names to MIDI values for left hand.
        pitches_right (dict[str, int]): Mapping note names to MIDI values for right hand.
        n_left (int): Number of left-hand chords to sample.
        n_right (int): Number of right-hand chords to sample.
        n_cross (int): Number of cross-hand chords to sample.
        seed (int | None): Random seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
