    Generate dyad states from two pitch dictionaries. A seed is manditory to replicate states if needed.
    It generets dyads left-left, right-right, left-right
    The order of the dyads will be shuffeld before returned

    Args:
        pitches_left (dict[str, int]): Mapping note names to MIDI values for left hand.
        pitches_right (dict[str, int]): Mapping note names to MIDI values for right hand.
        n_left (int): Number of left-hand dyads to sample.
        n_right (int): Number of right-hand dyads to sample.
        n_cross (int): Number of cross-hand dyads to sample.
        seed (int | None): Random seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        list[frozenset[int]]: A list of dyads, where each dyad is a frozenset of two MIDI pitches.
        int seed (which seed)
